# VNL Sub-optimality Forward Model
I am currently researching into the theoretical aspects of Continual Learning and Transfer Learning with advising from professor Talmo Pereira in the Salk Institute. I try to frame the general problem of Continual Learning from the perspective of Reinforcement Learning & Cognitive Neuroscience, hoping to develop algorithms that utilize the same strategies of "how we learn" onto an artificial agent. Moreover, I hope that such development can serve more than an engineering improvmenet, but rather contributing back to the neuroscience community to understand more about ourselves.

I am developing a conceptual framework that may be used for families of algorithms and I am trying to build internal representations for artificial agents through designing a Forward Model, one similar to what we think the Cerabellum is doing in human brain, so their learned skills in one task can be modularized and transferable to other control tasks. The belows are some training results on classical control problems using our SoFM-PPO algorithm (an adaptation using Supervised Forward Model and Proximal Policy Optimization).
