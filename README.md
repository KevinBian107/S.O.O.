# VNL Sub-optimality Forward Model
The cerebellum have been long theorized to play an crucial rule in motor control and learning (Forward modeling). Corollary discharge encodes a efferent copy of the motor command to be processed to predict the consequences of actions before sensory feedback is available. Such process would help us predicts how the sensory state of our body will change and how should these actions be performed, achieving better performances in control.

Using examples from (Albert and Shadmehr, 2018), with the starting and ending positions in hand, the parietal regions of your cerebral cortex compute the path of the arm that connects these positions in space the trajectory of the movement. After the trajectory is determined, your primary motor cortex and other associated pre-motor areas then carefully transform this sensory signal into a motor plan, namely the patterns of muscle contraction that will move your arm along the desired path towards the coffee.
