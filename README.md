# Sub-Optimality Optimization (S.O.O.)
We need to focus on the core problem in this project: how to construct a good q-distribution that captures overall environmental dynamics (1. how do we get enough sampling at each subtask? 2. How can we gradually learn this cohesive picture, not focusing on the forgetting part, rather focus on building a holistic picture) while developing task specific policy that works well enough given current environmental status  (1. how can we build such general controller?)

As human, we never even get the full signals of a picture, rather, we piece whatever "energy" we can get and create such hollistic picture that we see. The question now is how can we constructs such process in an machine?
