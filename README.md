# Sub-Optimality Optimization (S.O.O.)
I am currently researching into the theoretical aspects of Continual Learning with advising from professor Sicun Gao in UCSD CSE. I try to frame the general problem of Continual Learning from the perspective of Reinforcement Learning & Cognitive Neuroscience, hoping to develop algorithms that utilize the same strategies of "how we learn" onto an artificial agent. Moreover, I hope that such development can serve more than an engineering improvmenet, but rather contributing back to the neuroscience community to understand more about ourselves.
